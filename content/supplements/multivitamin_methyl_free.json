  "description": "It's not always possible to get all the necessary nutrients from food, so a multivitamin can help bridge the gap. This specialy formulated multivitamin does not contain methyl groups, which can cause negative reactions.<br></br>People living with autoimmune disease may be more likely to have a MTHFR genetic variation, which can increase sensitivty to methyl groups. This methyl-free supplement is more likely to be better tolerated (<a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9173919/'>PubMed</a>)."
