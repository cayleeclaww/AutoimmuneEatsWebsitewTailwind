      "content": "Nutrition can have a huge impact on how severe your autoimmune disease is, for several major reasons. </p><br/><p>First, about 70% of our immune system lies within our intestines (<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18721321/' target='_blank'>PubMed</a>). Since autoimmune diseases are described as an overactive immune system, nutrition and the related field of gut health have a huge impact on how bad your symptoms are. </p><br/><p>Second, a properly functioning immune system requires adequate nutrients to operate. It's important to eat well enough to support the immune system, so it has all the tools it needs to complete its essential functions.</p><br/><p>Third, autoimmune diseases can come with a whole host of unpleasant symptoms. This includes painful inflammation, stomachaches and other gastrointestinal issues, higher risk of heart disease, and more. Nutrition can play a huge role in reducing or even completely eliminating these symptoms. </p><br/><p>However, while eating well is crucial to improving the painful symptoms of autoimmune disease, it's essential to understand that people with autoimmune diseases are more likely to also develop eating disorders (<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25147950/' target='_blank'>PubMed</a>, <a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30178543/' target='_blank'>PubMed</a>, <a href='https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/140/6/e20162089/38188/Eating-Disorders-Autoimmune-and-Autoinflammatory' target='_blank'>American Academy of Pediatrics</a>). For this reason, it is simply unethical to recommend diets or dieting to autoimmune disease sufferers.</p><br/><p>It's easy to make the mistake of thinking that an eating disorder looks like not eating enough or throwing up after eating - but these disorders can be more complicated than that. There are many types of eating disorders, and the same eating disorder can look very different from person to person. </p><br/><p>For those with autoimmune disease, it's common to see people suffering from orthorexia, which is an excessive obsession with eating \"healthy\". While it's important to nourish yourself well, it's just as important to not obsess over it or morph the practice into something that is, paradoxically, unhealthy. Research is now beginning to show light on this important topic (<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9919523/ target='_blank'>PubMed</a>).</p><br/><p>The key is to find ways to gently help yourself eat well a majority of the time, while still maintaining plenty of room to enjoy all your favorite foods, whether they are \"healthy\" or \"unhealthy\" or somewhere in between. </p><br/><p>For many people, this is simply not the advice they want to hear. It can be very tempting to get caught up in the excitement of starting a diet, thinking this will cure all your pains. Some people may experience a relief in symptoms when attempting these severely restrictive diets - however, the results are rarely if ever long lasting, and the culprit food is almost never identified. Therefore, it is simply not worth attempting these dangerous diets. Ultimately, dieting in an attempt to alleviate autoimmune disease can be described as self-harm. This includes all diets, even the AIP diet and other types of elimination diets."

      "subtitle": "Worst Foods for Autoimmune Disease",
      "hrefID": "Worst-Foods-for-Autoimmune-Disease",
      "content": "<p>Categorizing foods as \"good\" or \"bad\" is a slippery slope to developing disordered eating and/or an eating disorder, for which folks living with autoimmune disease are at higher risk (<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25147950/' target='_blank'>PubMed</a>, <a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30178543/' target='_blank'>PubMed</a>, <a href='https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/140/6/e20162089/38188/Eating-Disorders-Autoimmune-and-Autoinflammatory' target='_blank'>American Academy of Pediatrics</a>). Additionally, different people react to the same foods differently. </p><br/><p>For these reasons, it's not recommended to try and identify a list of the “worst” foods for autoimmune disease. Additionally, even if this were recommended, the list would be different for each person. </p><br/><p>However, it's important to note that food sensitivities are a common trigger for autoimmune disease. Identifying any potential food sensitivity and limiting your intake of it can significantly reduce your symptom severity. While identifying your personal food sensitivities can help the healing process, it's best to avoid all elimination diets. </p><br/><p>Elimination diets require you to stop eating a long list of foods at the same time, and slowly reintroduce them over time. For the vast majority of people, it's impossible to be so strict with your food intake without risking a decline in mental and/or physical health. </p><br/><p>To learn how to safely identify food sensitivities without, first choose one food group that you suspect is causing you problems. Most people with autoimmune disease find that they are sensitive to gluten, dairy, or nightshade vegetables (peppers, tomatoes, eggplant, etc.). First, identify all sources of this potential sensitivity in what you normally eat, then find acceptable alternatives to those foods (for example, find a gluten free bread or a dairy-free yogurt that you like). Then, try to avoid consuming your suspected food sensitivity for one month as much as possible, using your acceptable alternatives to help you continue to enjoy eating. After one month, reintroduce your food sensitivity. Monitor your symptom severity to determine if you are reacting to this food.

      "hrefID": "Autoimmune-Disease-and-the-Anti-Inflammatory-Diet",
      "content": "<p>While some diets have very particular fixed rules, the anti-inflammatory diet does not. There is not \"one specific anti-inflammatory diet\" (<a href='https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/anti-inflammatory-diet' target='_blank'>John Hopkins Medicine</a>, <a href='https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/nutrition/anti-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory-diet' target='_blank'>Arthritis Foundation</a>). </p><br/><p>To best understand this, it's helpful to look at the definition for the word \"diet\". A diet can mean \"a regimen of eating and drinking sparingly,\" or it can mean \"food and drink regularly consumed\" (<a href=' https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diet' target='_blank'>Merriam-Webster</a>). While the first definition is problematic and can lead to disordered eating or worse, we can use the second definition to learn how to use the anti-inflammatory \"diet\" in a safe manner.</p><br/><p>Instead of following a strict \"diet\" - like the first definition - instead we can work towards changing our normal, daily diet - like the second definition. By increasing our intake of foods that will help reduce inflammation, and decreasing our intake of foods that promote inflammation, we can achieve the anti-inflammatory “diet” without actually going on a “diet.” (Seems like we should find another word besides “diet”!)</p><br/><p>The most important thing to do is to focus on which anti-inflammatory foods you would enjoy eating more of. Make sure to find ways that you actually enjoy eating these foods - or else it won't be a sustainable, lasting change.</p><br/><p>That said, there are several foods and nutrients that can help reduce inflammation. Foods high in omega-3, vitamin C, polyphenols, prebiotics, and probiotics can help us feel better with their anti-inflammatory properties (<a href='https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/anti-inflammatory-diet' target='_blank'>John Hopkins Medicine</a>).</p><br/><p>Omega-3 reduces inflammation by tipping our body chemistry away from inflammation (<a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257651/' target='_blank'>PubMed</a>). </p><br/><ul>Best sources of omega-3:<li>Salmon</li><li>Herring</li><li>Mackerel</li><li>Sardines</li><li>Tuna</li><li>Anchovies</li><li>Oysters</li><li>Caviar</li><li>Flaxseeds</li><li>Chia seeds</li><li>Walnuts</li><li>Hemp seeds</li><li>100% grass fed meat and dairy products</li><li>Pasture-raised or omega-3 enriched eggs</li><li>Spinach</li><li>Brussels sprouts</li><li>Purslane</li><li>Soybeans (<a href='https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/anti-inflammatory-diet' target='_blank'>John Hopkins Medicine</a>, <a href='https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-omega-3-rich-foods' target='_blank'>Healthline</a>) </li></ul><br/> <p>Vitamin C is an antioxidant, which helps reduce inflammation. Fruits and vegetables are the best source of vitamin C. </p><br/><ul>Best sources of vitamin C:<li>Red and green peppers</li><li>Kiwi</li><li>Broccoli</li><li>Strawberries</li><li>Brussels sprouts</li><li>Cantaloupe (<a href='https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/' target='_blank'>National Institutes of Health</a>) </li></ul><br/><p>Polyphenols are naturally occurring compounds that protect the body from inflammation. Most plant-based foods contain polyphenols, like vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.</p><br/><ul>Best sources of polyphenols:<li>Berries</li><li>Cloves</li><li>Peppermint</li><li>Star anise</li><li>Oregano</li><li>Celery seed</li><li>Sage</li><li>Rosemary</li><li>Thyme </li><li>Cocoa powder</li><li>Flaxseeds</li><li>Olives</li><li>Coffee and tea (<a href='https://www.webmd.com/diet/foods-high-in-polyphenols' target='_blank'>WebMD</a>)  </li></ul><br/><p>Prebiotics feed healthy microbes, and are generally high in fiber. Probiotics contain the actual healthy microbes themselves. Both prebiotics and probiotics promote healthy microbes in your intestines, which can reduce inflammation. </p><br/><ul>Best sources of prebiotics: <li>Garlic</li><li>Onion</li><li>Asparagus</li><li>Banana </li><li>Oats</li><li>Leeks</li><li>Barley </li><li>Apples</li><li>Cocoa</li><li>Flaxseeds</li><li>Jicama </li><li>Seaweed</li><li>Wheat bran </li><li>Chicory root</li><li>Dandelion greens</li><li>Jerusalem artichoke</li><li>Burdock root  </li></ul><br/><ul>Best sources of probiotics:<li>Yogurt</li><li>Sauerkraut</li><li>Kimchi</li><li>Miso</li><li>Kombucha</li><li>Kefir</li><li>Tempeh (<a href='https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/anti-inflammatory-diet' target='_blank'>John Hopkins Medicine</a>, <a href='https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/19-best-prebiotic-foods' target='_blank'>Healthline</a>, <a href=https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-super-healthy-probiotic-foods' target='_blank'>Healthline</a>)  </li></ul><br/><p>Some of the above foods may be new to you. It's a good idea to try a new food several times, prepared in different ways, to determine if you like it or not. However, you should never force yourself to eat foods that you don't like, especially after multiple tries, even if it is \"healthy\". Focus on eating the above foods that you truly enjoy. </p><br/><p>Finally, there are foods that can promote inflammation. These foods include: red meat (like steak and hamburgers), processed meat (like bologna, bacon, and lunchmeat), baked foods (like pies, cakes, cookies, and brownies), white flour (like some breads and pastas), deep fried foods (like French fries, donuts, and fried chicken), foods and drinks very high in sugar (soda, candy, sports drinks, jelly, and syrup), and trans fats (like in margarine, microwave popcorn, and non-dairy coffee creamers). It is NOT necessary to completely remove these foods from your life (<a href='https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/anti-inflammatory-diet' target='_blank'>John Hopkins Medicine</a>). </p><br/><p>Focus on consuming more of the above anti-inflammatory foods. It's perfectly fine to consume foods that may promote inflammation from time to time, and it's never necessary to entirely cut out these foods from your life. </p>"
