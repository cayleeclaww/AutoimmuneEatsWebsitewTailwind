Lupus joint pain is a major issue, as approximately 95% of people living with lupus will experience joint pain at some point (<a href='https://www.hss.edu/conditions_joint-pain-lupus-really-arthritis.asp' target='_blank'>HHS</a>). </p><br/><p>Reducing inflammation is critical for those living with lupus. Inflammation can damage vital organs, leading to a buildup of scar tissue, which can eventually cause organ malfunctioning and deterioration (<a href='https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/cbd-and-lupus' target='_blank'>Yale Medicine</a>). </p><br/><p>This is no different with lupus joint pain: a main goal is to reduce inflammation, which will also ease pain.</p><br/><p>Foods and nutrients that may help improve lupus arthritis include:</p><ul><li>Omega-3 fatty acids</li><li>Curcumin, from turmeric</li><li>Reducing gluten</li><li>CBD</li></ul><br/><p>Simple changes in your overall eating habits can <a href='https://www.autoimmuneeats.com/nutrition-and-supplements/Best-Autoimmune-Disease-Diet-Anti-Inflammatory-or-AIP-or' target='_blank'>improve inflammation levels</a> and therefore improve lupus joint pain, as well. </p>"

Omega-3s support your heart, lungs, blood vessels, and immune system (<a href='https://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/omega-3-fatty-acids-fact-sheet' target='_blank'>WebMD</a>). </p><br/><p>Research demonstrates that omega-3s are anti-inflammatory and have the ability to improve how the immune system is functioning. These properties can provide significant benefit for chronic diseases like lupus, including decreased disease activity and a decreased need for anti-inflammatory drugs (<a href='https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07315724.2002.10719248' target='_blank'>JANA</a>). </p><br/><p>A 2020 meta-analysis of five randomized controlled clinical trials found that omega-3 supplements reduced lupus activity. The participants of these studies consumed 3 grams or less of omega-3 supplements, with timelines ranging from 12 to 52 weeks (<a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568997220302652' target='_blank'>ScienceDirect</a>).</p><br/><p>Another study compared the results of 13 different research articles. Eight of these trials demonstrated an improvement in lupus patients taking omega-3 supplements, with minimal adverse events (<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35023407/' target='_blank'>PubMed</a>). </p><br/><p>An even larger meta-analysis reviewed 17 randomized controlled trials to assess the pain relieving effect of omega-3s on joint pain. </p><br/><p>Most of these trials studied patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, which are two other types of autoimmune diseases associated with joint pain. Patients in these trials reported reduced joint pain intensity, less morning stiffness, fewer painful and/or tender joints, and needing to take less pain medications (<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17335973/' target='_blank'>PubMed</a>). </p><br/><p>Although not directly evaluated here, this study suggested that omega-3 supplementation may benefit lupus joint pain, as well. </p><br/><p>Speak to a healthcare provider like a dietitian or doctor before beginning a new supplement. Omega-3s have blood thinning properties, and may be problematic if you are already taking a prescription blood thinner. </p><br/><p>Omega-3 supplementation is a promising way to manage lupus arthritis and lupus joint pain.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Curcumin is another nutrient that can be helpful for unpleasant symptoms like lupus joint pain. Curcumin is an active compound within turmeric that has anti-inflammatory properties. </p><br/><p>A 2023 systematic review looked at the results of 10 different studies on curcumin and lupus. Their findings show that curcumin has the potential to reduce disease activity, however they were unable to recommend a uniform dosage from the studies reviewed (<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36867423/' target='_blank'>PubMed</a>).</p><br/><p>Curcumin has been shown to improve joint pain in rheumatoid arthritis, another autoimmune disease defined by joint pain. One study found significant reduction in tenderness and swelling of joint scores in rheumatoid arthritis patients given 500 mg of curcumin. </p><br/><p>These researchers also found curcumin treatment to be safe and with no adverse events (<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22407780/' target='_blank'>PubMed</a>).</p><br/><p>Another meta-analysis of 539 rheumatoid arthritis patients found that curcumin reduced inflammation, improved joint swelling and tenderness, plus had other benefits when compared with controls (<a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1121655/full' target='_blank'>Frontiers in Immunology</a>). </p><br/><p>While curcumin may improve your lupus joint pain, it's important to note that simply adding turmeric to your food may not be sufficient. Turmeric only contains about 2 to 6% curcumin, so the amount in food may not be enough to experience benefits.</p><br/><p>Additionally, unfortunately there have been reports of dishonest manufacturers selling fake turmeric. The coloring additives that are used to recreate the characteristic yellow of turmeric in these fake versions can be contaminated with lead. </p><br/><p>Instead, it's recommended to stick to <a href='https://www.autoimmuneeats.com/nutrition-and-supplements/top-supplements' target='_blank'>curcumin supplements</a>, following the manufacturer's instructions for dosing. Take this supplement with a meal to increase absorption (<a href='https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/nutrition/anti-inflammatory/turmeric-wont-help-arthritis' target='_blank'>Arthritis Foundation</a>). </p>"

In a study of 130 lupus patients, researchers found five times the prevalence of celiac disease as compared to in the general population (<a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8103411/' target='_blank'>PubMed</a>). </p><br/><p>If you have undiagnosed celiac disease, this may contribute to lupus joint pain.</p><br/><p>However, it's important to know that you don't need to have celiac disease or even be allergic to gluten in order to potentially benefit from reducing or avoiding gluten. It's possible to have food sensitivity to gluten, which is not detectable by medical tests.</p><br/><p>Gluten is a common food sensitivity in people with all kinds of autoimmune diseases. Researchers reviewed and combined the results of 83 different studies, all of which looked at the impact of a gluten-free diet on various autoimmune diseases. Across all 83 studies, they found that 64.7% of patients experienced a reduction in symptoms from a gluten-free diet (<a href='https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/80/3/525/6335547' target='_blank'>Nutrition Reviews</a>). </p><br/><p>To evaluate whether or not you are sensitive to gluten, complete a <a href='https://www.autoimmuneeats.com/nutrition-and-supplements/worst-foods-for-autoimmune-disease-what-you-need-to-know#Food-Sensitivities' target='_blank'>food sensitivity trial</a>. </p><br/><p>Foods that contain gluten include breads and breaded foods, baked goods, pastas, beer, and more.</p><br/><p><strong>RELATED:</strong> <a href='https://www.autoimmuneeats.com/by-disease/Hashimotos-And-Gluten-Whats-the-Best-Hashimotos-Diet' target='_blank'> Hashimoto's And Gluten: What's the Best Hashimoto's Diet?</a></p>"

As cannabis has become increasingly legalized and available, so has CBD.</p><br/><p>Research into the effectiveness of CBD and other cannabinoids for treating lupus is still in its early stages. However, there is growing evidence that CBD may be able to help autoimmune symptoms like lupus arthritis. Currently, there is new research being conducted on the topic (<a href='https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/cbd-and-lupus' target='_blank'>Medical News Today</a>). </p><br/><p>In a 2022 statement on medical marijuana, the Lupus Foundation of America stated that “research conducted to date has shown that cannabinoids may be somewhat effective in treating pain from arthritis and related conditions, but other research has also suggested potential adverse effects and interactions with medications” (<a href='https://www.lupus.org/resources/organizational-statement-on-medical-marijuana' target='_blank'>Lupus Foundation of America</a>). </p><br/><p>A lower quality study with a self-selected convenience sample of 428 people with joint pain reported improvements after using CBD. 83% of respondents experienced improvements in pain, 66% had physical functioning improvements, and 44% of all respondents reported pain reduction after CBD use (<a href='https://jcannabisresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42238-022-00154-9' target='_blank'>Journal of Cannabis Research</a>).</p><br/><p>More research is needed on CBD and lupus arthritis.</p><br/><p>If you would like to try CBD, beware as there are many scam products on the market. State-approved marijuana dispensaries may be more reputable locations to purchase CBD, replete with knowledgeable staff. </p><br/><p>Choose a brand that does third-party testing. Start by ingesting a low dose, and gradually increase. Many CBD products are meant to be ingested, but topical CBD products may help lupus joint pain, as well. </p>"
