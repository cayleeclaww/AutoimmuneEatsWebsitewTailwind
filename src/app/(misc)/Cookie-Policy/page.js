          This Cookie Policy explains how Eat Your Veggies Nutrition PLLC
          ("Company," "we," "us," and "our") uses cookies and similar
          technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at
          https://www.autoimmuneeats.com ("Website"). It explains what these
          technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to
          control our use of them.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or

        <h2 className="text-2xl my-4 uppercase">What are cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
          mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
          website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
          efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
        </p>
        <br></br>{" "}
        <p>
          Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Eat Your Veggies
          Nutrition PLLC) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by
          parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies."
          Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be
          provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive
          content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party
          cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in
          question and also when it visits certain other websites.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h2 className="text-2xl my-4 uppercase">Why do we use cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          At this point in time, we do not use cookies. However, we may use
          first- and third-party cookies in the future, for several reasons. In
          the future, some cookies may be required for technical reasons in
          order for our Website to operate, and we will refer to these as
          "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies will also
          enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance
          the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties will serve
          cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other
          purposes. This is described in more detail below. This policy will be
          updated as our use of cookies evolves.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h2 className="text-2xl my-4 uppercase">How can I control cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          Once cookies are utilized on this site, you will have the right to
          decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You will be able to
          exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie
          Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager will allow you to select
          which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies
          cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with
          services.
        </p>
        <br></br>{" "}
        <p>
          Once available, he Cookie Consent Manager will be found in the
          notification banner and on our website. If you choose to reject
          cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some
          functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. You may also
          set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.
          This policy will be updated once a Cookie Consent Manager is
          available.

          What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
          website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time,
          like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs").
          These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that
          enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened
          an email including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the
          traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another,
          to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have
          come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a
          third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the
          success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these
          technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so
          declining cookies will impair their functioning.

          Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local
          Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store
          information about your use of our services, fraud prevention, and for
          other site operations.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can
          adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies
          storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings
          Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global
          Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may
          include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing
          Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how
          to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your
          being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash
          Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you
          are on at the time).
        </p>
        <br></br>{" "}
        <p>
          Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit
          acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of
          some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications
          used in connection with our services or online content.

          Do you serve targeted advertising?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to
          serve advertising through our Website. These companies may use
          information about your visits to this and other websites in order to
          provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may
          be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to
          measure the effectiveness of advertisements. They can accomplish this
          by using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your
          visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant
          advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you.
          The information collected through this process does not enable us or
          them to identify your name, contact details, or other details that
          directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
